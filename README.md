## Tools
- [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-tile-atlas)
- [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/), [Tiled - Documentation](http://doc.mapeditor.org/), [Tiled - GitHub](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled)
- [Phaser \(2.7.7\)](https://phaser.io/download/stable) Not a tool but a really cool HTML5 game framework that the project is based on.


Gimp and Export layers plugin
The plugin allow you to export all layers as separate images witch is perfect for making an animation with a frame per layer. Just extract into a texture packer smart folder.

Texture packer
Really great tool to pack all your sprites. Efficient, quick and easy.

Tiled (and a couple of python scripts)
The map is made in the excellent map editor Tiled. I used the the scripts described here to convert a map image into a tilemap.

Editroid
Metroid specific rom-hacking. Makes it possible to dump all Metroid map as image, which I then use the scripts described above to convert to a tilesheet and tilemap.

Atom.io
A free hackable editor that just gets better.

ES2015/ES6
The game is written in ES2015/ES6 transpiled and package using this Phaser ES6 Boilerplate.
